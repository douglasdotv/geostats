This is a personal project to visualize places I've virtually visited in the world in [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/). It tracks my guesses across different game modes through a userscript and stores them in a database. The data is then displayed in a [web application](https://geostats-xi.vercel.app) with location comparisons and some country statistics.

The main tools used in this project were Supabase, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and MapLibre GL (in addition to the userscript to persist data, which was written in JavaScript).
