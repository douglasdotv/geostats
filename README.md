GeoStats is a personal project that tracks the places I've virtually visited in [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/).

A userscript running in the background records my guesses across different game modes and stores them in a database. The data is then displayed in a [web application](https://geostats.info), allowing me to view the places I've been and my guesses, as well as some statistics by country.

This project was built with **Supabase, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MapLibre GL**, along with a custom userscript to handle relevant data retrieval and persistence.
